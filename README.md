Used a combination of heap, hashMap, sliding window methods to process data stream.
My program took about 44s to process on my computer, so the speed is about 100k records/s.
Usage: java -jar ./src/Insightoa.jar ./log_input/log.txt ./log_output/hosts.txt ./log_output/hours.txt ./log_output/resources.txt ./log_output/blocked.txt
